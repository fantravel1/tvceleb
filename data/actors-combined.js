    "bio": "Bryan Lee Cranston is an American actor, director, and producer who rose to global fame for his portrayal of Walter White in the AMC drama series Breaking Bad (2008-2013). Born on March 7, 1956, in Canoga Park, California, Cranston began his acting career in the early 1980s with small television and film roles before landing recurring parts in shows like Airwolf and Raising Miranda.\n\nCranston first gained widespread recognition as Hal, the lovably eccentric father in the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle (2000-2006), earning three Emmy nominations for the role. However, it was his transformative performance as the chemistry-teacher-turned-drug-lord Walter White that cemented his legacy as one of the greatest dramatic actors in television history. The role earned him four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nBeyond Breaking Bad, Cranston has built an impressive film career with roles in Argo (2012), Godzilla (2014), and Trumbo (2015), the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination. He also won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson in the Broadway play All the Way (2014). Cranston continues to be one of the most respected and versatile actors in the entertainment industry.",

He was a student with minimal acting experience when he was cast in his breakout role, which required a unique and physically demanding performance.\n\nDorobantu gained international recognition for his role as Thing, the disembodied sentient hand and loyal companion of Wednesday Addams, in the Netflix series Wednesday (2022-present). Performing entirely through hand acting while wearing a blue suit for visual effects removal, Dorobantu brought remarkable expressiveness and personality to a character with no face or voice, earning widespread praise for his physical performance artistry.\n\nThe role of Thing in Wednesday represented Dorobantu's first major screen credit, and his inventive physical performance drew comparisons to classic mime and puppetry traditions. He has become a fan favorite at conventions and events for the show.",

He then achieved critical superstardom as Carmen \"Carmy\" Berzatto, the brilliant but troubled fine-dining chef who returns to Chicago to run his family's sandwich shop, in the FX series The Bear (2022-present).
